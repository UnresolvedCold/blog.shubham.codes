### Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

# I'm Shubham 

### Welcome to My Corner of the Internet

I'm someone who thrives on problem-solving, whether it's in software architecture, AI/ML, or optimization. 
Beyond code, I have a deep curiosity for psychology, biology, and seemingly unrelated fieldsâ€”because connections often lie where we least expect them.

This space is where I share my learnings, insights, and experiencesâ€”bridging technology with a broader perspective. Stick around, and let's explore together.

If interested, you can find more about me [here](/about).
